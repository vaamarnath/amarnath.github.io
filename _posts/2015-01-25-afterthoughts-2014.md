This post has been long due. I have been putting it away for quite sometime.
2014 is a year that did leave a mark on my life. I decided to quit my 
comfy job at McAfee India and decided to purse higher education. 

#### Thought process before IIT Guwahati

My peers at work and friends was stunned when I resigned immediately after securing
admission into M.Tech. + Ph.D. in Computer Science and Engg. at IIT Guwahati. It 
just looked stupid to them that I made such a decision. To leave a well paid job,
look for stream change from from Electronics and Comm. to CS and to move one of
the not so great IITs. But, I made the decision in just a fraction of second. 

Yes, I was earning well in Bangalore but does that imply I was happy with whatever
I was doing. No! That's the sole motivation I had to make the decision. From how 
I look at the Indian offices of (almost) all technology giants are just the 
clerical section of theirs. The monotonic and ugly work is pushed onto the Indian
offices where the work gets done at less than one eighth of the cost. And, to make
matters worse, the IT crowd here are not keen in improving their state by showing 
their counterparts that they too can innovate and have great amounts of creativity.
The Indian society is not particularly tuned to make this happen. They are just
interested in getting a job which will assure them regular inflow of cash and are 
happy in getting about their mediocre family life. 

After almost trying to make wonders happen at my office, I got my message. Unless
the environment and the peers are willing and motivated enough, one man can't change
the fate of his/her career. Innovation is just another joke in almost all 
offices in Bangalore. Everyone talks about it, but no one provides the environment 
and support for pursing it.

My GATE result was not great. But it was just enough for getting me clear all 
eligibility criteria for research programmes at IITs. I thought it would be better
I give it a try to secure admission. And IIT Guwahati was were I finally got the 
admission call. Without much procrastination, I decided to take the plunge. The 
only question I asked myself was, "Am I happy about what I have decided?". 

#### Current thoughts

Yes, I am still happy about my decision. No regrets! 

I have spent one full semester in IIT Guwahati now and I am accustomed to 
people, hostel life and procedures in place. After getting here, once again I 
come to realize how mediocre and stupid I am when compared to the people around me.
Previously, it was not the case. Now, every day I feel how minuscule I am. Several
of the courses I attend are along with the undergrad students and those classes 
are real worthy to me. 

If I am asked to compare how different is IIT Guwahati from NIT Calicut, I would say
the students here are much more enthusiastic and active in gaining knowledge. And
the environment the institution provides is more positive and leans towards 
academic proficiency along with other activities. The best part of any student life
is to have great and awesome teachers. Here at IIT Guwahati I have had the pleasure
of interacting and spending time with a handful of them.  

I agree probably IIT Guwahati is not the best place to be in India for research
in CS, but I believe its up to oneself to touch the excellence in research and
currently I am striving to do the same. Let me see where does this exciting journey
take me from here.
