Its been sometime since I have blogged. To be exact my blog has been idle for over 2 months. It was not just the blog that was idle, it was me too. I had done with my B.Tech. in May 2011 and it was a long break before I joined in a MNC in Bengaluru in July. There was nothing much to blog about as my mind as well as my body stayed idle at home for weeks.</p> 

Now, life has changed. Its been over 2 weeks since I am in Bengaluru. Feels good to be here in the Silicon Valley of India or call it the Garden City. Life seems to be a lot different from what it was in NITC. It demands more responsibility and more dedication now.

Bengaluru has been a wonderful place to be. I have started to like this place. The BMTC buses, the &#8216;Bangalore&#8217; climate, the occasional rains,Â  the malls and don&#8217;t know what more is there to be explored. Looking forward to more adventure, success and lots more from this city with my *first* job.
