I just came across a video online about the online posting vulnerabilities. It was about how people should be careful about the stuff they post online, you say it facebook, twitter or any other social online media. Even I have felt about this when I see my college mates posting sensitive messages, photos and videos on these sites. Maybe it includes me too, knowingly or unknowingly. But, as a matter of fact, this is actually an issue that we need to understand and recognise how important is it to take care about posting stuff.</p> 

I feel the youth nowadays, never care about the matter, but just want to see how far they can get hold of the attention of their friends on online social networking sites. They feel this is how they would be considered cool and maybe a &#8216;dudified&#8217; guy. I believe its more important for girls to see that they don&#8217;t post more sensitive material online in whatsoever site. Yet, another problem that I have noticed is that the privacy settings of facebook, the most widely used site, does change from time to time without proper notification to the users. By default, I believe all content you post in facebook is available to every internet user and hence that brings a hell lot of trouble. Just look into the illustration shown below about how the personal info you provide in facebook is available to internet users.

  Teenagers and youth needs to care about what they are postingÂ  before they ran about the publicity of stuff they or their friends did. These are some of the videos out in there in net that advocates &#8220;Think before you post&#8221; . So do really &#8220;THINK BEFORE YOU POST&#8221; something online as once its online, it&#8217;s never offline.
