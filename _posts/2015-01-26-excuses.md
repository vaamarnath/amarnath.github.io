title: Excuses
summary: What more do you need?
---

Yet another long weekend goes by and the ground reality is that I have 
not able to fully utilize it as I wish I had. With more to learn and 
explore daily, I am looking for excuses at the end of the day to explain
to myself why I have not been productive.

Each time I come up with a different explanation for unproductive days.
Once it would be taking a break from the busy schedule to watch and enjoy
a movie and another time it would be spend time with some friends here at 
college. But, is it the real cause for why I don't spend my time on worthwhile
stuff?

I think it's more about concentration and will to about the goal I have to reach.
Few days I lose track of my path to my goal and few other days due to some 
unforeseen external factors. But, most of the time it's because I am unable to
tame my mind and guide it along the direction I always hope it does.

I need to pay more attention on how I plan my day to see that I utilize the time
I have at hand much efficiently. I am thinking of keeping a tracker and reminder
for the same. If I don't do this right now, I fear that I might regret the time
I have lost. I better get on with my work right now.
