Just after the whole chaos of hostel issue settled after the Director granting single rooms for all final years. now its the placements that is catching everyone&#8217;s attention. Like Shanil said, every conversation among the final years now ultimately leads to placement discussions. Its a crucial juncture in our lives which decides a lot about our career just after our UG course.</p> 

Officially the placements of NITC have already started with some of my batch-mates bagging PPO from TI, Amazon and some other companies. The placement season begins on 28th July and its so close that everyone is so tensed about it. TI, GE, C-DOT, GS, Amazon, Bajaj and many other companies are expected to visit the campus  in the coming weeks and I expect that around 40% get placed.

Best wishes for all my friends for their placements.
