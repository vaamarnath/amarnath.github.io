Like all of you receive forward mail from friends, even I do get some. Recently I received a really interesting mail about Windows from 
<a title="Karthik R." href="https://twitter.com/k4rthikr" target="_blank">Karthik R.</a>, my fellow batchmate in B.Tech. CSE.</p>

> No, Windows is not a virus. Here&#8217;s what viruses do:
> 
>   * They replicate quickly. Okay, Windows does that.
>   * Viruses use up valuable system resources, slowing down the system as they do so. Okay, Windows does that.
>   * Viruses will, from time to time, trash your hard disk. Okay, Windows does that, too.
>   * Viruses are usually carried, unknown to the user, along with valuable programs and systems. Sigh&#8230; Windows does that, too.
>   * Viruses will occasionally make the user suspect their system is too slow (see 2) and the user will buy new hardware Yup, that&#8217;s with Windows, too
> 
> Until now it seems Windows is a virus but there are fundamental differences: Viruses are well supported by their authors, are running on most systems, their program code is fast, compact and efficient and they tend to become more sophisticated as they mature
> 
> So, Windows is **not** a virus, it&#8217;s a bug.

Its not that being a FOSS enthusiast, I hate or discourage the use of Windows. Its just simply because of these reasons that make me feel so. We are paying several hundreds of rupees to get such a product that is just a so called &#8216;stable&#8217; release which is filled with bugs. I don&#8217;t just understand the reason why people do like using Windows. !!!
