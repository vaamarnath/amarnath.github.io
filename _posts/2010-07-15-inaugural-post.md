<p id="top" />
This is my second attempt in the blogging domain. The first one was about a year ago which I started as a result of desperation in 4th semester of my engineering course. I could just put a few posts then, as I stopped blogging when I regained my confidence in me to do well in academics. You may go through them at

Now, I thought of starting a blog to put up my project work reports and also try blogging in a consistent fashion. Initially, I thought of using posterous.com to publish my reports, but later found that its not really dynamic as WordPress is. Hence, I am switching over to WordPress from my <http://amarnath.posterous.com>.

Cheers
