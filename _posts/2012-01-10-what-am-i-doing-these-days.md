Its been really long since my last post. I thought I&#8217;d make it clear that I&#8217;m not dead or lost. I am still here up and running like any other server online. Its just because I don&#8217;t have anything to blog about, neither personal nor anything social.</p> 

After my graduation, I&#8217;ve lost touch with the society and many of friends, except a handful of them. I just make a call once in while to them. And life is moving as it is. Staying with my sisters in Bengaluru, with some family responsibilities on my shoulders. Yeah, I do the grocery shopping and take care some other household chores.
</p>

Beyond that, I just spend time watching movies, listening to music, thanks to the BSNL broadband connection. Yeah, nowadays, I commute to office with my Trek. Cycling has become part of my routine.

Life seems monotonic since I have started working. Is it the same for everyone, or is it just me?
