  I have been thinking of starting a blog for last few months. But couldn&#8217;t start one untill now. I am an second year Electronics and Communications engineering student in NIT Calicut, which claims to be one of the best engineering institution after IITs in India.

    I was really proud when i had joined this institution that I reached somewhere special where my schoolmates couldn&#8217;t make to. Of course except a few who made into IITs. But now I feel its not the right place for a person like me. To explain what makes me think so is really difficult to explain.
