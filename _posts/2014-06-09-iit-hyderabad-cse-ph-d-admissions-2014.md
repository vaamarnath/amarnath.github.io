IIT Hyderabad shortlists candidates based on GATE score and resume of the candidates. Shortlisted candidates are called for test and interview at IIT Hyderabad campus in May for admission process.</p> 

Test consists of a two papers. Paper 1 is objective test of 1 hour duration. Paper 2 is subjective and is of 2 hours duration.
</p>

Paper 1 spans topics from discrete mathematics, algorithms, data structures, networks, systems and databases. It is almost similar to GATE CS syllabus.

For Paper 2, the candidate can opt from Systems & Networks, Discrete Mathematics & Algorithms or Machine Learning & Pattern Recognition. I had chosen Discrete Mathematics & Algorithms for my paper 2. Few of the questions that I am able to recollect are jotted down here.

1. From set {1,2,3,&#8230;,n} choose (a,b,c,d) such that a+b = c+d. Give the number of tuples that satisfy this requirement.  
2. Prove that any number of circular regions overlapping or non overlapping can be colored with 2 colors such that no two adjacent regions have same color.  
3. Given a connected graph G, prove that it does not have any bridge e.

Finally in each of the areas, about 6 students were shortlisted for interview. And I did not get through the tests. End of story!
