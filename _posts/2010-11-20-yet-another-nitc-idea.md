      Is there a shortage of water in Calicut or Kerala at this time of the year? Looking out of the window, I never feel so. The retreating monsoons are treating the nature at its best. Its been raining heavily every afternoon for the past 10 &#8211; 15 days.
    </div>
    
    <div>
      But <a class="zem_slink" title="National Institute of Technology Calicut" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Institute_of_Technology_Calicut">NITC</a> water supply department seems many other big plans. Seems like it&#8217;s trying to save a lot of running water from the river for the summer. About 10 days ago, a notice was published quoting the disruption of water supply to hostels and academic buildings till further notification for maintenance. It says,
    </div>
    
    <blockquote>
      <div>
        Schedule of water supply
      </div>
      
      <div style="padding-left:30px;">
        Hostels and residential buildings: 6AM to 9AM and 6PM to 9PM
      </div>
      
      <div style="padding-left:30px;">
        Academic and administrative buildings: 8AM to 3PM
      </div>
    </blockquote>
    
    <div>
      The notice says that reason for the rescheduling of supply time is due improper closing of taps after use and delay in intimation about leaking points. The reason seems pretty valid and true. But, I never understand how they manage to come up with such ideas at such awkward times. The end semester exams for the students are ongoing and the shortage of water puts a lot of difficulty for students.
    </div>
    
    <div>
      The main fault behind such an action is that they never follow the schedule of water supply. For the last few days, there is no water in hostels at 7AM and 8PM even though its within the pumping time mentioned in the notice. Yet another point the authority misses is that once they have started this water supply pattern, a huge volume is simply wasted because of leaving the taps open during night. Once the pumping restarts at 6 in the morning, hell lot of water is simply drained off. Nobody wakes up in hostels at 6AM to shut the taps. See, the whole idea of saving water indirectly leads to much more loss.
    </div>
    
    <div>
      Yet another point, which is emphasized on the notice is that the institute incurs a heavy monetary loss due to misuse of water in campus. But, the whole thing boils down to looking forward to conserve water in all possible methods. Its never done in NITC and I believe never will it be. Just by cutting short the water supply time does not save water for the future. Water has to be saved in some form. As far as I know, NITC is making use of the water from the nearby river for all its needs. The river dries up in summerÂ  which leads to shortage of water in March &#8211; May every year. To save water, just by pumping less would lead to a solution. The authorities are missing this point.
    </div>
    
    <div>
      Being a monsoon dependent state, I believe its high time that NITC implemented some form of rain water harvesting in campus. I have not seen any form of rain water harvesting techniques employed in even the newly constructed buildings and blocks. This is yet another key point that needs to addressed soon for better water management in campus.
    </div>
    
    <div>
      The authority could have come out with another option for the maintenance of water supply in campus. After about a week, its the winter break for the students. During that time, the campus would be sparely populated and the water supply schedules can be manipulated in any form they need to.
    </div>
    
    <div>
      But like every administration shows off its bureaucratic face, NITC administration is trying hard to reveal its own to the students without looking into the well being of the students.
