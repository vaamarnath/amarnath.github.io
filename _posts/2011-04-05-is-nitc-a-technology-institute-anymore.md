*Before I start off with the discussion, I would like to be frank that whatever I have written here is just a bird&#8217;s eye view of the whole NITC culture. These have come up as a result of several discussions I have had with my friends, seniors, juniors and some of the faculty members. It does not project the whole system effectively. All the points I put forward may not be **absolutely **true and many of my friends in NITC may not be taking a similar stand on these.*</p> 

I still remember how I came into this college, National Institute of Technology, Calicut about 4 years ago as an immature, reserved teenager. Like most of the freshers do have, I too had lots of dreams and expectations from this prestigious college and how its going to transform my life. But after 4 years of engineering studies, I find myself in the same position as I was when I joined this institute. Have this institute contributed something academically to my resume? I don&#8217;t feel so.
</p>

From the past 3 years experience, what I have observed is that, the number of students or faculties turning up for any kind of technical event is really small in number. But, in case of a DJ night or a dhandia night, you can see 100s of students thronging in the basket ball court or in the audi. This is when I recollect something one of the faculty member asked me when I was in my second year. He was also trying to understand the reason why students are losing their technical interest so early in their UG life.  Let me quote what he asked me,

<p style="padding-left:60px;">
  <em>&#8220;Once in REC, philosophy used to inspire students, but now even technology does not inspire them&#8221;</em>
</p>

Sir asked us if we had some solution to this issue and how students can be attracted to the technical projects and events. But we did not know what was going wrong. We did not have an answer to it. Actually that question had never struck us till then and had never thought about it.

From then on, I was knowingly or unknowingly searching for an answer for it. I will try to give some causes for the declining interest of students in technical fields. This may not give an overall view of the problem and its root reasons. I have just tried to assess the problems, but did not seek solutions. I have come to these conclusions based on what I have felt over these years and the outcomes of arguments and discussions with many of my batch-mates and what they felt was going wrong with them.

One of the primary reason which I believe as the root course of this problem is the hostel system followed in NITC. Unlike IITs, here students of each year are allotted rooms in a single hostel, whereas in IITs and some of the other major engineering colleges, students of a branch from different years are given a hostel. I feel such a hostel structure do have a lot of impact on the technical interest of students. See for example, I know several of my batch-mates who are really technically sound but do not know the juniors. In these cases, what happens is that the seniors are not able to share the knowledge they have acquired and the juniors are missing a chance to exploit the expertise of a senior whom he would have come to known if they were in the same hostel. Yet another point that comes up here is that, each year I find students working hard on the similar kind of project in robotics or on a problem statement which another set of students from their senior batches may have worked and solved spending numerous hours. But, the junior students rarely comes to know about this and they will have to work from scratch for their project. I feel instead of this, if the seniors were able to share their experiences and knowledge with juniors, they could have worked on some more advanced level in the field. I feel a common hostel for students from a branch would have effective in a lot of knowledge sharing among them.

Another reason, which I feel as a hindrance for technical knowledge sharing is restrictions imposed in the name of ragging. The recent judgements to  prevent in ragging in educational institutions by Supreme Court is really helpful in ill treatment of juniors by seniors. But, these judgements also hinders the free and open bonding that the freshers used to build in their campus life with seniors earlier. These relations do play a major role in deciding the entire campus life structure of students. What happens now is that mostly the juniors are free to be with seniors during various college and club events where they do not get guided well into their own fields of interests. So by the end of their first year, they find themselves in some weird situation with no one to guide except their peers.

Yet another point I would like to put forward is about conduct of Tathva. I know that the sole aim of Tathva is to encourage students in taking up new technical projects and make them innovate beyond their normal academics. But, till now with what I have seen and experienced is that Tathva fails in standing upto its purpose. With more than 2000 UG students during my second year in NITC, I have seen several events which did not even have a NITC team participating. This has continued in every other Tathva I have been till now. I would like to remind that the number of UG students have gone upto  almost 4000 now. I feel the situation is getting worse. I firmly believe that we need to adopt a strategy like we have for Ragam each year. We need have selection for college team for each event of Tathva and have them guided and trained under the seniors so that we would have a representation in each event. In case of Ragam, this fact is taken care off very well to keep up the prestige of the institute. This should be the case with Tathva too.

In a technical institute the utmost priority should be given to academics and in an engineering institute like NITC, I should say equal priority should be given to practical and technical work of students. This would give an opportunities to students to innovate and think out of the box. Here the semester system just ruins the life of students. Let me just try to give a hint of a semester in NITC. The odd semesters start by the end of July and lasts till end of November and the even semesters begin by end of December and finishes off by April. In a short span of 17 weeks, we have 70+ working days in each semester. I would not say the syllabus is really tough. But the point is that to cover 6 papers in 70 odd days is damn tough. One needs to just study and study whole of the semester. The system does not give room to explore technology. If you do not be updated about the classes for a week, then you would have to just forget about it. The sessional exams come up every 5 weeks and at the end, the final exams also just pops out from nowhere. You just don&#8217;t know how a semester flew by when you were into some other work.

I could get clear cut thoughts of the above mentioned causes. I know there are several others too, about which maybe I would write about sometime later. With this blog, I have never intended to put forward the idea that NIT Calicut is not the place to be for your UG course. But see to it that you have someone to guide or you yourselves have a target to get to. This may lead you through the obstacles you come across. Even though I do have a lot of thoughts about NITC which really drives me mad, I do feel happy to be here with the company of best friends of my life. NIT Calicut may not have given anything quantitatively, but indeed have given me my best buddies.
