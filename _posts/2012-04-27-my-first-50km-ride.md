You&#8217;d be thinking why would someone talk about his/her 50km ride. Its really not a big deal to cycle 50kms from what I have seen and heard about other cycling enthusiasts in Bengaluru. But it was a real milestone for me and my friend Firdous. I had been planning for a long ride with Shanil for a long time. Maybe from December 2011. The plan was made several times and there were occasions when Shanil even was about to rent a cycle for the weekend long ride. But the plans would end up in trash due to several reasons. Sometimes it would be the nature playing its tricks and otherwise it would be the human factor in it.</p> 

Finally after 9 months since I got my bicycle and after a truck load of persuasion to get Firdous into the ride, we decided to pay a visit to IISc Bangalore on 21st April. I had not been to IISc ever since I have been in Bengaluru. So I thought it would be the right time to meet up with some college-mates and give Kiran and Arjun their convocation photos.

We planned to start 8am in the morning and reach IISc by 10am. But as usual, the human factor shows its ugly face. Firdous as usual woke up by 8o&#8217;clock. He had to cycle 12kms to reach the starting point whereÂ  I would meet him. He was delayed by 30-40mins and we started our unforgettable ride by 8:45am.

We started from Silk Board and carried along with Hosur Road with the traffic building up in the morning hours. The Bengaluru climate was its best, overcast with some sunshine. Perfect for a cycle ride. We buzzed past the signals at St. Johns and Forum to carry on with our leisure ride chatting with each other with our own preparations for the ride. We crossed Richmond Road and moved towards Queens Road. Just after we reached the Raj Bhavan Road, my front tire got flat. We had been cycling only for about 30mins and now we were facing the unforeseen obstacle. I had earlier got a flat about 6months back and never after that in my rides to office. About 600kms without punctures. Maybe I just got precautionary ever since I had two consecutive flats in November last year. But this time something had gone wrong terribly. And I had not taken my patch kit with me to fix the flat. To be frank I never expected something to come up in a city ride. But now I was proved wrong. Now started the search for Local Bicycle Shop to get my cycle fixed. But the search seemed endless, the road from Raj Bhavan towards Yeswantpur via the Chowdaiah Road seemed to be a high profile area. Either star hotels or government offices to be seen on either side of the road. We had to seek help from every pedestrian or cyclist coming across us asking for a repair shop nearby. Most of them just kept on answering positively and giving us hope. But we had to walk about 4kms to get a real repair shop near Seshadripuram to get my cycle fixed. My worst fears got blew away once the guy at the shop showed me that the puncture was the old one and the patch had come off due to summer heat. He said its normal to happen.

While I was getting my puncture fixed, Firdous sneaked away to get his breakfast. Then we continued our ride to IISc and we reached IISc by 11am. More than an hour late as per our schedule. We did the 15kms in more than 2hours. Kiran and Arjun had come to meet us at the gate and then started the conversation about why our cycles are expensive. I find it real difficult to prove to others why the bicycles are expensive. Nowadays, I just keep nodding to their silly comments about my bicycle, why there is not bell or why the fenders are weird looking and so on.

After settling at Kiran&#8217;s room, we went out for a ride in IISc campus. But we ended up in the restaurant in the campus instead. We had our stomach full and some ice cream to cool ourselves. Then we went on to explore the green, serene and empty lanes in IISc. The ride inside the campus was tension free, just ride without caring about the vehicle behind you, because there is no vehicle behind you!

Again in crashed into Kiran&#8217;s room and caught up with some other college-mates. By 3pm, we stared from IISc to Marathahalli, our second pitstop. The route from IISc to Marathahalli via Outer Ring Road was not something I liked. The construction work progressing in ORR is a real hindrance for cyclists. The pollution and dust is way over high. But, we had to look for the shortest route to Marathahalli as the sun was getting strong on us in the afternoon. Finally we decided to take the CV Raman Road and get along Bellary Road to reach Hebbal and ride to Marathahalli via Outer Ring Road. Destination was 25kms away. The traffic was heavy on CV Raman Road and Bellary Road till Hebbal. After that, the traffic reduced and we were able to ride along and chat about everything under the sky. We had to take 2 &#8211; 3 breaks to hydrate ourselves in the summer heat. Finally by 4:30pm, we landed in Marathahalli.

Firdous had now done 50kms already and he called it a day. He decided to stay overnight and leave Marathahalli the next day. I decided to continue my ride to home. I had to read my magic figure of 50kms in a day. By 5:45pm I started from Marathahalli and riding towards Silk Board via Outer Ring Road. About 13kms to my home. I decided to complete it in 1hour. Riding alone means reaching home before it getting dark. So I decided to ride fast from Marathahalli. Riding alone turned out to be faster for me. I reached home by 6:30pm. I did my last 13kms in 40mins. That was impressive after my 40+ ride earlier in the day.

The day was really remarkable. Doing my 50km was a barrier. Now, broken that, I believe I would be able to carry forward for a 100km ride. Waiting for the next ride plan!
