  Like many of you, ever since I was in  school I have been hearing this statement. &#8220;Next year this time you&#8217;re going to enjoying your life. Let&#8217;s work hard now and sit down, relax and enjoy later&#8221;. The first occasion when I heard this was during my tenth board study vacations. One of my teachers told me you can have a blast after your boards. But did that happen? NO!
</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">
  Next, it was the JEE that popped up into my life. The JEE coaching began just after the tenth boards and now it was the coaching center chief to recite the same set of lines as though it&#8217;s is a <em>mantra</em>. They used to point out how life would be after your plus two in either the IITs or NITs. Virtually they put you to force yourselves to your limits describing those. Years went by, (I mean only 2), and fortunately or unfortunately I just could not get an admission in an IIT with my JEE rank. Alas, I ended up in NIT Calicut.
</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">
  In NITC, in each and every semester I hear that next semester is gonna be easy. This would be the last one that troubles you. But the last never came. Now, in final year, I feel more pressurized. Is this a never ending scheme? I have heard seniors telling that once you get a placement in final year, the rest of the time you spent in campus is enjoyment and nothing else. I have never experienced anything of this kind after getting placed about a month back.
</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">
  Is this like the &#8220;carrot and stick&#8221; policy? I think life gets miserable wherever we are, once we care to do stuff and that too trying to do it perfectly. I believe that the attitude a person decides a lot about how he is enjoying his life. I think, I seriously need a change in attitude to enjoy my last few 100 days in NIT Calicut.

  At this juncture, I would to quote a sanskrit quote that I came across a few days back.

<p style="text-align:justify;">
  Taken from महाभारत, when the wise minister &#8216;vidura&#8217; विदुर is advising the emperor &#8216;dhRitarAShTra&#8217; धृतराष्ट्र he says that &#8216;<em>Do the right thing, the just thing, and you will have nothing to worry. For worrying destroys everything</em>.&#8217;
