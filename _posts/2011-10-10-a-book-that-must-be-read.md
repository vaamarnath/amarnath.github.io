My rating: [4 of 5 stars][3]

Reluctantly, I ordered &#8216;India Unbound&#8217; by Gurcharan Das in first week of September. I have never read any books related to economics or any of his books. But once I started to read the book, I was so impressed by the way Das explained the economics of India in rather simple words.  
Gurcharan Das has been able to convey the minute details of the License Raj just after India attained independence under Jawarharlal Nehru and how Nehru intended the welfare of the people of the country but which turned out to be the most disastrous step taken by him. Das explains the details in such a way that the reader never feels that what Nehru had done was not completely out of the track, but was not suited for India.  
Das goes on with the way India sailed through 70s and 80s and how India came under huge debt by early 90s. He also gets into much details about the opening up of the economy in 1991 by Dr. Manmohan Singh under the strong leadership of P. V. Narasimha Rao who steered the reformers all the way through.  
Das later gets into the way India progressed in late 90s and early 21st century under the IT revolution. Das has been instrumental in keeping the reader interested throughout book. He has quoted several instances from his own life to make things simpler for the reader.

I would recommend this book whoever is keen in knowing the economic history of India from mid 20th century onwards. The book is lively to read.
