title: Moving to Jekyll
summary: The big step for re-initiation to blogging.
---
This blog has been lying inactive for months now and I have been trying to move
away from my self hosted Wordpress site. Maintaining the Wordpress is a bit tricky.
I have to keep my Wordpress updated and plus I have to keep track of the plugins 
I have been using and keep them up to date. This is necessary to make sure that
my site is not compromised to any of the many security flaws that gets discovered
every now and then.

Additionally, I really did not take care of maintaining any backups of my blog. It
was just hosted at a cheap hosting service and I have not guarantee that my data 
is in safe hands. 

That is when I came across Github pages. I thought it would be great to have my
blog hosted on Github and serve it over from there. I just started out to figure
out how it is to be done only to come across the 
[blog post](http://tom.preston-werner.com/2008/11/17/blogging-like-a-hacker.html)
by Github co-founder
[Tom Preston-Werner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Preston-Werner). 

I was excited to try it immediately and created a subdomain under 
[vaamarnath.co.in](http://speakup.vaamarnath.co.in) and tested it out. 
And, magically everything fell in place. I had to spend a bit of time exporting my
Wordpress posts to Jekyll and tinkering with the media links in my posts. Other than 
that, everything else was just like a breeze. 

I am planning to try out Jekyll for few days and then decide on nuking my 
Wordpress site. Till 'en.
