I am V. A. Amarnath. I have graduated in B.Tech. in Electronics and Communication Engg. from 
<a title="NITC" href="http://nitc.ac.in" target="_blank">National Institute of Technology, Calicut</a>. You may contact me at vaamarnath [at] gmail [dot] com.</p> 

I find it really difficult to describe about me and my character. But, let me try to do that now.
</p>

I was born and brought up in Ernakulam, Kerala. I did my school education at Bhavan&#8217;s Varuna Vidyalaya, Thrikkakara. And then later joined NIT Calicut to do my professional course.

I am really attached to this city Ernakulam, Kochi or Cochin whatever you call it. I have lived my entire life here except for sometime I spent in my college campus. I love being in the city but hate the congested roads and the traffic snarls of the mosquito ridden Kochi.

I am a supporter and follower of Free and Open Source Software. Actually, I love the philosophy underlying it. Thanks to <a title="Deepak Sir's Blog" href="http://deepakwrites.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Deepak Sir</a>, <a title="Kishore's Blog" href="http://kishoreathrasseri.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">Kishore A.</a> and many other seniors who have pulled me into this wonderful world. I have been actively involved in some of the community activities and supporting the <a href="http://fosscell.nitc.ac.in/wiki/index.php/Main_Page" target="_blank">FOSSCell</a> at NIT Calicut.

I have also been involved in several technical activities at college through the IEEE student branch at NIT Calicut.

Now, I am working in a MNC in Bengaluru as Software Engineer. Life is getting more and more tougher with growing responsibilities and other burdens. Let&#8217;s see how am I going to tackle it!

I think I have lot more to add to this, will do it as time progresses.

You can download my [CV][1] here to get more info on my professional background.
