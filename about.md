I am V. A. Amarnath. I am currently a research scholar at IIT Guwahati spending time 
in delving into Theoretical Computer Science. Previously, I have earned
my bachelors in Electronics and Communication Engg. from 
[National Institute of Technology, Calicut]("http://nitc.ac.in") which has nothing 
to do with whatever I am doing right now. 

In my earlier avatar at NIT Calicut I had spent hours together promoting and exploring
Free and Open Source Philosophy. Right now I am just passive follower and supporter
of the movement.

I have spent some time at Bangalore working for McAfee India and the only part
that stood out during that phase of my life is my passion for cycling. It was 
great to cycle in Bangalore in early mornings and beating traffic while commuting
to office. I miss those cycling days.

Now being at IIT Guwahati, I do not get much time to tinker upon various 
passions I have. Maybe its just how I prioritize my tasks right now. Reading is the
only pass time I have right now.
